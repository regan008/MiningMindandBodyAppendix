## Approaches and Considerations for Using Data Mining to Identify Discourses in Digitized Publications

As historical source material continues to be digitized and made available through open access repositories such as Google Books, Chronicling America, the Internet Archive, and HathiTrust, historians are increasingly faced with an abundance of material. The amount of digitized historical material available has made made historical material more accessible to both scholars and the public. Rather than needing to go to a physical location to read copies of a journal such as Mind and Body, one can simply read it on Google Books in their browser or even download it to their tablet’s ebook reader.  However, the amount of material that has now been digitized also presents new challenges for historians.  Keyword search isn’t sufficient due to errors in the text’s optical character recognition (OCR) and can also be a problematic research strategy.   In addition to the problems encountered once an individual text is identified, finding the text itself and grappling with the sheer volume of digitized material can be problematic.  

This paper draws on the digitized run of Mind and Body, a monthly periodical about physical education, to illustrate the power of algorithmic reading as a research tool for dealing with large amounts of digitized material. Using Mind and Body as a case study, this paper represents the beginnings of a much larger project that will track the developing discourses about physical culture for women through numerous publications over roughly sixty years. In addition to topic modeling and other forms of text analysis, the broader project will also draw on techniques such as network analysis to track contributors, editorial committees, institutions and organizations across these publications. Beginning with just this subset of material, I want to use this paper to make two suggestions about the possibilities and advantages of using data mining as a research tool in the digital present.

First, digitization efforts have created vast online archives and keyword search has emerged as the starting place for most scholars who seek to explore them. However, keyword search can be, in itself, deeply problematic. Search algorithms used by search engines, such as Google, tend to filter results based on previous searches and are largely a black box. There is no way to be reproducible or systematic about the results that appear. Further, by cherry picking what is being searched for in a text, our research practices are inherently biased. Topic Modeling, a probability algorithm, can be a more useful research tool and this paper aims to suggest that data mining techniques can offer entry points into a large corpus of text and aid scholars in identifying discourses within the text. By allowing the algorithm to group, sort, and filter the text, a research methodology that involves forms of text mining can return some of the serendipity to the research process.[^1]

Secondly, I’d like to suggest that digital methodologies are simply are a starting point. We cannot rely alone on results returned by algorithms and these results are only useful when combined with close readings of the source documents. The advantage of algorithmic reading, however, is that it has the potential not only to answer questions posed but also to prompt new questions by revealing patterns that may have been missed using traditional historical methods.

In order to analyze the digitized run of Mind and Body, this paper utilizes an approach known as Topic Modeling. Put simply, a topic model is a form of probabilistic modeling which can be used to identify the “thematic structure” within a large corpus of text. Coming from the fields of machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model discovers the “topics”, or groups of reoccurring words, which make up a document or set of documents. Miriam Posner has aptly described a topic model as “a method for finding and tracing clusters of words (called “topics” in shorthand) in large bodies of texts.” Using this approach on the corpus of Mind and Body, this paper seeks to discuss the potential of digital methodologies for historians in the digital present.

###Mind and Body
Mind and Body, a monthly publication, began publishing at a moment when physical education was beginning to emerge as a viable vocation. The publication emerged at a critical time in the history of physical education and worked to support the profession by republishing talks given at local conferences, circulating news, and publishing resources for physical educators. Closely associated with the North American Gymnastic Union, the successor to the German-American Turnverein, Mind and Body continually supported those within the profession and provided a platform for debates about physical training in schools. The prominent role of Mind and Body within the physical education community between 1894 and 1936 makes it a useful text for this case study.

Physical Education was not a new field in 1894. Rather its roots reach as far back as the 1830s but it did not begin to become a widespread vocation until the late 19th century. Beginning in the 1830s and lasting well into the 1920s a controversy over the type of physical education that should be practiced raged throughout the United States. The “Battle of the Systems,” as it was known, pitted German, Swedish and English systems of exercise, often carried over to America by immigrants, against each other. German immigrants established Turner societies in the United States which promoted gymnastic training while Swedish immigrants aimed to promote health through prescribed light movements. In contrast, the English school of thought advocated for physical education though sports and games. They argued that participation in sports and games helped to encourage moral development. The pressure to implement prescribed physical activity in school was successful when, in 1855, Cincinnati became the first city school system to offer Physical education in public schools. California followed suite shortly after in 1866 and passed legislation requiring two exercise periods during each school day. Mind and Body advocated the German system most frequently and many of its board members and contributors were involved in Turneverin’s across the country. However, while many of the editors were advocates for the German system they frequently allowed others to present the opposite point of view and provided a space for debates.

The “Battle of the Systems” raged throughout the 19th century however, by the turn of the century when physical education was undergoing professionalization, developments in science and medicine began to influence how educators prescribed physical exercise. As Martha Verbrugge has discussed in her work Active Bodies: A History of Women’s Physical Education, the field set out to “secure an occupational niche, train practitioners, create a unique base of knowledge and expertise, and build an infrastructure for advancing and regulating itself.” Mind and Body was one of several publications that emerged in the 1890s and aimed to support the new profession.

Throughout its run, the journal’s content reflected debates within the physical education community about the proper types and amounts of exercise for both women and children, the role of the gymnasium in civic life, as well as scientific discussions and debates about the effects of exercise on the body. Furthermore, the journal chronicled the professionalization of physical education as an occupation in America and is a valuable source for the study of exercise and physical culture in the early 20th century. Using “Distant Reading” techniques such as topic modeling and text mining, this paper seeks to identify the major debates and discussions within the Mind and Body corpus, identify locations for “close reading”, and analyze the changing nature of discussions about physical education between 1884 and 1937. Using Mind and Body as an example, this paper will discuss topic modeling as a technique for “distantly reading” a corpus of text. However, “distant reading” is only useful when coupled with close reading and strategies for moving between the two are at the heart of this paper.

In addition to supporting a growing vocation, Mind and Body often published discussions regarding the importance of training the body in addition to training and shaping the mind. As science and knowledge about the human body became more advanced in the early twentieth century, educators often argued over the role of science and medical knowledge in the gymnasium. Some believed educators should use their position to conduct research and produce findings on the effects of exercise on the body while others believed that research within the gymnasium was a distraction and educators should, instead, focus on refining their pedagogical methods. This tension between research and pedagogy is often reflected within Mind and Body and was a consistent topic as the vocation worked to establish guidelines and standards for the profession. As a result, the voices included within Mind and Body tend to be diverse. Contributors often included medical professionals, educational professionals, and municipal officials from cities across the United States. In addition to reprints of lectures, original articles, and lesson plans, the editorial committee often published translations of foreign texts about physical education and physical training for men, women, and children.

While the balance between research and pedagogy was often a concern in Mind and Body, most agreed that physical education was of the utmost importance and was useful in training not only the body but also the mind and spirit. For proponents of physical training in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, exercise of the body in a mechanistic and efficient manner shaped not only the exterior appearance of the body but also helped to hone the mind and the spirit. In its first issue, Carl Betz, a frequent contributor to Mind and Body, argued that “drills, exercises, plays, games and sports all go toward preserving the equilibrium of all the physical and psychical forces of the body, in order that the soul (mind) can attain its highest state of perfection.” While the authors who contributed to Mind and Body often debated the proper type of exercise as well as the balance between research and pedagogy, most agreed that the aim of gymnastic work was both physical and spiritual.

The unique history of Mind and Body and its position in the field during a pivotal moment in the history of physical education make it an ideal candidate for a case study of digital methods. Using the entirety of the digitized run, we can ask questions about how the publication changed over time and how the discussion about physical education shifted as the vocation matured. Between 1894 and 1936 Mind and Body published four hundred and thirty-three issues over forty-two volumes and the digitized corpus contains over seven and a half million words. This corpus provides a useful case study of how topic modeling can be used to assist scholars in identifying trends, discourses, and debates and it is a useful starting point before adding other influential texts to look at the profession more broadly.

###What is a Topic Model?
A topic model, a concept derived from the fields of machine learning and natural language processing, is a statistical model that is used to discover “topics” that occur in a collection of document. In its most basic sense, a topic model is a “probabilistic model of texts.” The algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), takes every word in every document and assigns it to one of a given number of topics. These “topics”, are composed of a distribution of words – they are “a model of how likely given words are to co-occur in a document.”
The topic model algorithm assumes that each document is composed of a particular number of “topics.” For example, one would assume the words “dog” and “bone” to appear more in often in a document about dogs than the word “meow” or “cat.” However since the algorithm assumes that each document is composed of numerous topics, the results may indicate that the document is 90% about dogs and 10% about cats. In other words, the document has 9 times more dog words than it does cat words. While this is a simple example, one can look at some of the topic modeling projects by historians to see more sophisticated and relevant examples. “Mining the Dipatch,” for example, is a project an exploration of the themes and patterns within the Richmond Daily Dispatch during the Civil War. To take just one topic as an example, Nelson finds that the topic containing the following words:
> “NEGRO YEARS REWARD BOY MAN NAMED JAIL DELIVERY GIVE LEFT BLACK PAID PAY RAN COLOR RICHMOND SUBSCRIBER HIGH APPREHENSION AGE > RANAWAY FREE FEET DELIVERED”

referred to Fugitive Slave Ads and he concludes that this points to the “resiliency of the institution of slavery in Richmond during the Civil War.”

In recent years numerous historians have used topic modeling to confirm their analysis of a textual corpus as well as to create online archives that allow users to explore the text through an entry point much different from keyword search. Two examples are worth discussing when pointing to the potential of algorithmic reading for digital research. Cameron Blevins has a series of blog posts entitled “Topic Modeling Martha Ballard’s Diary.” In the Cameron Blevins’s series of blog posts, “Topic Modeling Martha Ballard’s Diary,” he discusses the astounding ability of the topic model to parse Ballard’s diary into themes that are consistent with Laurel Thatcher Ulrich analysis of the diary. For example, Blevin’s graph of the Emotion topic over time shows that the spikes in the graphs relate to moments in Ballard’s life that were tumultuous. As Blevin’s work illustrates, topic modeling has the potential to sort through historical material and identify themes with relative accuracy. Whether as a tool to support an argument or as a research tool, the possibilities of topic modeling for historians are evident.

A second, and more recent, project worth mentioning is the Yale library’s project “Robots Reading Vogue.” The project, which is composed of various “experiments” that apply digital methodologies to the complete digitized run of Vogue, showcases the potential for a topic model to serve as an entry point into a large corpus of digitized text and as an alternative to a search engine. In “Robots Reading Vogue,” each topic offers an entry point into the digitized archive and presents a useful way to grapple with the entirety of the material within. The themes that are presented such as “dressmaking,” which declines across the twentieth century, offer users the opportunity to ask questions about the material and then compliment inquiries with a close reading of documents within the archive.

Together these two projects are excellent examples of the potential of topic modeling as a tool for historical research. This paper aims to apply this methodology to Mind and Body as both an entry point to this large corpus of text but also to answer the broad question, how did the publication’s focus shift over time as the physical education vocation developed? Did editorial changes influence the discourse within the publication? And can we pinpoint major shifts in discourse within the corpus?

The topic model used for this paper was generated by MALLET, an open source topic modeling tool developed by David Blei. Each issue of Mind and Body was extracted from Google Books, optical character recognition software was used to extract the text, and then MALLET stripped out a list of common words, known as “stop words,” from each text. Finally, MALLET ran the model on the cleaned documents and returned a set of topics as well as a matrix that provides the proportion of each topic in each document. Figure 2 shows the presence of the sixty topics in Mind and Body over its 42 years of publication and figure 3 displays the top words from all sixty topics. These figures may appear overwhelming, but by breaking the topics down and looking at the words within in the topic, the topic’s weight within the corpus over time, as well as at the individual documents where the topic is particularly salient we can begin to see patterns within the corpus.

To begin with a simple example, the top words from topic 0 are not overly surprising and are consistent with what one would expect to find in a publication about physical education. The top words, “arms sideward bend trunk arm upward exercise repeat straighten return,” are terms that we would expect to find in descriptions about exercises performed in schools. Although not particularly insightful, this topic can be useful in identifying issues of the publication where a discussion about performances of exercise were discussed. In April 1926, an issue that the topic model found to be 16.6% about topic 0, an article entitled “Obligatory Tactics and Free Exercises for 33rd National Turn Fest” is discussed. Mind and Body often printed the formations and exercises that would be performed at a national festival such as the Turn Fest.  This topic also occurs frequently in issues where exercise compositions are published for reuse by other educators.  Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the model can distinguish between words used in exercise descriptions like those described above and words used to describe instructions for games (topic 56) and those describing “apparatus work,” or work that involved gymnastic equipment such as a long horse. The ability of the model to distinguish between types of exercise makes it a powerful research tool for exploring the content published in Mind and Body and will allow for further research into how the description of these exercises changes over time.

###What can a topic model tell us about the history of physical education?
The complete list of topics offers several interesting insights into how the discussions about physical education within Mind and Body changed as the publication and the profession expanded. The three examples discussed below illustrate both the changes in the publication but also the potential of a topic model for exploring historical documents.
The model often has the potential to pinpoint debates and discourses that the researcher may not have expected or identified on their own.  Topic 49, upon first glance, appears to be a topic about health education and the role of the state.  The top words, “health education physical state program service hygiene states medical community”, seem straightforward at first glance but by digging a bit deeper into the documents themselves it becomes clear that this topic is actually much more interesting.   

First, if we examine the top words in the topic as a word cloud, where the first thirty words are weighted based on their frequency within the topic, we can begin to see that the most frequent words are health, education, and physical. Words such as state(s), hygiene, medical, bureau, and war appear less frequently, but still prominently within the topic. The appearance of the word “war” here is significant and we can begin to guess what this topic is referring to.

If we look at the average distribution of this topic over time, we can see that it begins to spike beginning in 1915 and is more prominent throughout the latter half of the corpus. What is striking about this topic is the sharp spike in the topic that continues through the 1920s and doesn’t decline in 1918 once World War I finishes. To figure out why this topic spikes and whether it represents a shift in the discourse we need to drill down and examine the documents through “close reading.” Examining documents where this topic is prominent, it becomes clear that not only is this discourse discussing the necessity of health education, the topic is identifying a specific set of documents that discuss necessity of “adequate physical preparedness” in the aftermath of high draft rejection rates due to the health and fitness of young men during World War I.

Throughout the twentieth century there has been heightened focus on youth fitness, unsurprisingly, in periods of war. After the close of World War I, the physical education community spoke often and with great concern about the number of drafted men who were deemed “unfit” for duty due to their physical stature and overall health. One study found that on the East Side of New York forty percent of the young men were unfit for military duty because “of lack of proper nourishment and the lack of clinics to minister to their physical needs.” In the years following the conclusion of the war, many within the physical education community called for “adequate physical preparedness in America” and frequently debated how to better the health of America’s citizens. Advocates called on schools to work to improve the “essentials of health building” such as adequate physical examinations, sanitation of school buildings and regular inspection, health education and efforts to “build up the habits and health character” of children “though the application of knowledge about hygiene,” and, lastly, “physical education of the mind through activity.”

In January 1922, one issue where topic 49 ranked highly, the editors of Mind and Body ran an editorial entitled “Universal Health Education is Essential,” which reacted to early reports that no more than 25% of school children were physically fit. The article called for state intervention into the fitness of youth throughout the establishment of federal agencies to oversee Physical Education in schools. Specifically, he advocated for a Division of Physical Education within the Bureau of Education. By shifting from the macro, the numeric data about the corpus provided by the topic model, to the micro, the actual texts, we can make sense of the compilation of words and identify important discourses, such as this one, in the text.

What examining topic 49 illustrates is that the combination of distant and close reading is crucial to making sense of a topic model. In this way topic modeling can become an essential step in the research phase when presented with a vast number of digital sources. On the surface this topic appeared to be simply about health education but by digging into the words that makeup the topic, its proportion over time, and finally the documents themselves its clear that the model picked up something far more precise than simply a discussion about health education. Examining this topic at a closer level also raises a whole new set of questions such as “why does does the topic spike again in 1931?” and “Were calls for universal health education tied to tumultuous periods in the twentieth century?” In this way the model functions as a research tool that both answers questions and raises new ones for further investigation.

Topic 42 presents another interesting example. The topic, composed of the words “gymnasium room rooms bath baths building space water end city,” appears to be about the physical spaces in which physical education took place. Looking at the distribution of the topic over time, its clear that this is topic appears more frequently in the early years of the publication and declines steadily over time. Shifting to the individual documents themselves, we find that this topic is often about the construction of municipal baths and gymnasiums in cities such as Boston and New York. The topic refers not only to the efforts to build gymnasiums but also to how these spaces were constructed. Additionally, words like “city,” “care,” and “provided” point to the discussion of municipal responsibility in constructing, funding, and managing gymnasiums. For example, in the January and February issues from 1900, the editorial committee features an article series entitled “Free Municipal Baths in Boston” and discussed the efforts to build a system of municipal baths and gymnasiums which were justified on the “basis of health, physical development, and enjoyment, regarding the supplying of suitable means for wholesome recreation and please” which the local officials believed was “well within the lines of municipal policy.” Another article from the March 1907 issue, describes a “progressive and comprehensive plan” that can be used to establish a gymnasium and playground for a small city. The gymnasium, the focal point of a recreation complex as the article describes it, would consist of baths, playgrounds, a gym and a main entrance which the article proclaims should “also be the social room, the megaron, or gather room” and “it should have a cheerful fireplace and tables with books and magazines” in effect serving as a social center in addition to a space for recreation.

While this topic appears to be fairly straightforward it is useful to compare the use of gymnasium in this topic to topic 20. The top words in topic 20 are: “physical training work education class schools time department director classes general school normal good members gymnasium.” Gymnasium appears in both topics however in very different contexts. In comparison to a tool like an n-gram viewer, which displays the distribution of a particular word in the corpus over time, a topic model returns topics which may contain the same words but the probability algorithm groups the multiple occurrences by context. Although “gymnasium” appears in both topic 20 and topic 43, it is clear from the topic’s other words that the term is being used in different contexts. While topic 43 is about the physical environment of the gymnasium within the city, topic 20 is more about the work that occurs within the gymnasium.

A final example speaks to the influence of the editorial committee on the content published within Mind and Body as well as the changing discourse about physical education in the 1930s. The editorial committee shifted quite frequently in the early years of Mind and Body. Just between 1894 and 1912 the editorial committee for the publication changed eleven times. The committee remained stable between 1912 and 1927 when Grover W. Mueller, the Director of Physical Training in Philadelphia joined the editorial board.  A series of retirements in 1932 and 1934 would lead to further changes and in 1932 Mueller was made the managing editor of Mind and Body.  But what influence did these editorial shifts have on the content of Mind and Body?

To look at the potential influence of editorial shifts on the content of the publication, I overlaid lines representing editorial shifts on the graph showing the distribution of topics over time.  Looking at all the topics, one in particular stands out. The top words in topic 23 are: “education physical health program body recreation teacher achievement girls programs” and when we look at its distribution over time it is clear the topic begins to become more prominent in the early 1920s but it spikes after Mueller joins the editorial board in 1927.  Expanding the number of top words in the topic to forty reveals that other prominent words include: “leisure,” “Philadelphia,” “Mueller,” and “Grover” clearly suggesting that articles including the words recreation, health, physical, and education commonly occur near Grover Mueller’s name.  

No doubt this topic was beginning to increase before Mueller joined the editorial committee and some may object to jumping to conclusions about his impact on the publication.  Leisure and recreation were commonly discussed as important aspects of physical education during the 1930s, particularly spurred by New Deal programs that sought to establish spaces for recreation in cities, but the association with Mueller is fascinating.  Looking closer at the documents highly associated with topic 23, its clear that Mueller was writing editorials frequently as were a number of other individuals from Philadelphia.  We can’t say for certain based on the model that Grover began to influence the publication heavily, however the topic presents a starting point for a deeper analysis of the individuals who contributed to Mind and Body as well as the how the discussion about recreation, health, and leisure shifted in the late 1920s and 1930s.   

###Conclusions
Increasingly historians are being faced with large quantities of digitized source material. Mind and Body serves as a useful example though which to discuss some of the advantages of examining source material using algorithmic reading. By appropriating some of the techniques, such as topic modeling, developed by computer scientists and linguists we can begin to regain control of the research process in the digital age. Rather than allow Google or other search engines to filter what appears or using keyword search to pre-determinately search through a corpus of material, topic modeling provides us multiple entry points into digitized source material. In the digital present we must work to not only streamline our research methodologies to fit with the landscape of digital sources continually becoming available, but also work to discourage corporate companies to determine out methodologies for us.

Overall from looking at the sixty topics about Mind and Body, several generalizations can be made. In addition to these very specific examples of how the topic model results can pinpoint individual discourses within the corpus, we can also use the topic model to confirm some of the generalizations about the role of Mind and Body within the physical education community. First, throughout the publications life there were numerous shifts in physical education but the publications focus on children, schools, and teachers as well as the role of physical development within schools remained a consistent focus for the publication.  Although educators may have touted physical fitness in schools for different reasons in reaction to the social conditions of a particular moment, such as just after World War I, the focus on attaining physical fitness in schools nationally remained a consistent focus.  

Secondly, the relationship between hygiene, physical fitness, and disease shifted over time however the community’s belief in the effect of exercise on bodily and spiritual health remained a constant. One noteworthy shift is the increased focus on recreation in the late 1920s and throughout the depression.  Shifts from discussions about physical education in schools to the benefits of physical education for the community as a whole reflect the shifting activities of the profession as a whole. The changing relationship between these elements as well as in the actors who are discussing them and contributing to the publication warrants further analysis.

This topic model of Mind and Body is the start of a much larger dissertation length project. Next steps will expand this model to include other publications to discover how the discussion shifted depending on venue, examine the contributors to each of these publications, the institutions they were affiliated with, and the publications or organizations they were reprinting from.  Applying further contextual information to the model as well as to other forms of analysis such as Network graphs will reveal further trends, patterns, and help to identify influencers within the community.

In conclusion, “the digital present” to which this title of the conference alludes is riddled with opportunities but also challenges. As historians in the digital present we must work to be critical of our methodologies when working with online sources and ensure that we are dictating the process in a transparent manner.  Algorithmic reading techniques, such as topic modeling, present an opportunity for scholars to interact with digital sources in new and interesting ways that have the potential to reveal trends and patterns in ways traditional methods cannot.
